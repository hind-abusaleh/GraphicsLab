# Assignment_1, part_1
#### (1): 
In order to go through all the faces and all their vertices,
I added two functions to the MeshModel class which are:
print_faces () and- print_vers (),

The first goes through all the faces (in the faces vector that is in the MeshMoudel class), and then with the help of the GetVertexIndex method that is in the face class, we can know the index of the vertices and then know the coordinates through the Victor of The vertices that are within the MeshModel class.

#### (2):
In order to scale and translate the vertices such that they will fit inside the window,I need to change a bit in the LoadMeshModel function that is in the Utils class, when loading the model (in the while loop), I keep the maximum and minimum X and the same for Y and Z,
and at the end I keep the maximum of: x_max, y_max, z_max

So I can do the right scale (divide by maximum)
And then do translate with vector (abs (x_min), abs (y_min), abs (z_min)), so that all points are greater than 0.
And at the end the multiplier of the matrices generated by the scale and translate operation is included in the sheard_ptr that returned from the function (here we update the MeshModel constructor to include a 4x4 matrix).

#### (3):
For this section, I added two methods (to the MeshModel class) one to access the matrix of the model that we loaded, and the second one is to access the vector of the vertex in specific index,  
In the Render function we will access this matrix and then go through all the faces and make a 4vec (in the hom.cords) , by multiple the matrix by the vectors (of a specific vertex of the face (there are 3 vertices)), and in the end we draw the lines that connect the coordinates of the vectors (4vecs).

###### the code:

void Renderer::Render(const Scene& scene){

	int I1, I2, I3;
	glm::vec4 a1, b1, c1;
	glm::mat4x4 mymat;
	glm::mat4x4 Tmat;
	glm::ivec3 color(1, 0, 1);
	if (scene.GetModelCount()) {
		auto model = scene.GetActiveModel();
		mymat = model.GetM();
		Tmat = model.get_Transform_Mat();
		mymat =  Tmat *mymat;
		for (int i = 0; i < model.GetFacesCount(); i++) {
			I1 = model.GetFace(i).GetVertexIndex(0);
			I2 = model.GetFace(i).GetVertexIndex(1);
			I3 = model.GetFace(i).GetVertexIndex(2);

			a1 = mymat * glm::vec4(model.GetVer(I1), 1);
			b1 = mymat * glm::vec4(model.GetVer(I2), 1);
			c1 = mymat * glm::vec4(model.GetVer(I3), 1);
			DrawLine(glm::ivec2(a1.x / a1.w, a1.y / a1.w), glm::ivec2(b1.x / b1.w, b1.y / b1.w), color);
			DrawLine(glm::ivec2(a1.x / a1.w, a1.y / a1.w), glm::ivec2(c1.x / c1.w, c1.y / c1.w), color);
			DrawLine(glm::ivec2(b1.x / b1.w, b1.y / b1.w), glm::ivec2(c1.x / c1.w, c1.y / c1.w), color);
		}
		/*model.print_faces();
		model.print_vers();
		exit(0);*/
	}
}

#### (4):
For this section I added a 13 4x4 matrices, two for each kind of transformation (one for the world frame and the second for the local frame), and two for each rotation around each axis (6 matrices), and one matrix for the multiply of the matrices of the various kinds of transformations, and also we define 8 new methods to set those matrices(the methods to set the rotation of each axis were included in 2 methods) and one method to get the last matrix (the transformation matrix).

After load a model, the user can change the frame of transformation by click on the button "change frame" , and then we can choose a kind of transformation and see the results. by choosing a specific kind we make a change on the transformation matrix that we defined on the MeshModel class by use the appropriate method.

#### (5):
To show the results of the transformations on the model we should multiple the main matrix of the loaded model by the transformation matrix that we update according to the user choices, and then continue to draw the model as showed in section (3).
